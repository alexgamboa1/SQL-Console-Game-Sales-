# SQL-Console-Game-Sales-
Working with two data sets to analyze console game sales.

You are an analytics consultant helping a console game company conduct market research. You have been supplied a dataset consisting of two files. 

ConsoleGames.CSV 
- a historic list of all console games released between 1980 and 2015

ConsoleDates.CSV 
- a historic list of all console platforms (such as Wii, Play Station, Xbox) and information about them


You have been tasked to upload the dataset into a Database and perform the following analytics: 

1. Calculate what % of Glabal Sales were made in North America 

2. Extract a view of the console game titles ordered by platform name in Ascending order and Year of Release in descending order

3. For each game title extract the first four letters of the publisher's name

4. Display all console platforms which were released either just before Black Friday or just before Christmas (in any year)

5. Order the Platforms by their longevity in ascending order(i.e. the platform which was available for the longest at the bottom)

6. Demonstate how to deal with the Game_Year column if the client wants to convert it to a different data type

7. Provide recommendations on how to deal with missing data in the file
